# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview
The Colorado Board of Elections has retained us to complete an election audit of a recent local congressional election. Performance of the audit included:
1. Calculating the total number of votes cast.
2. Compiling a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculating the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculating the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determining the winner of the election based on popular vote.
## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1
## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.

The analysis of the county vote totals show that:
- Jefferson County had 38,855 votes cast and 10.5% of the total.
- Denver County had 306,055 votes cast and 82.8% of the total.
- Arapahoe County had 24,801 votes cast and 6.7% of the total.

The largest voter turnout:
- Denver County had the largest voter turnout with 306,055 votes cast and 82.8% of the total.

The candidates were:
- Charles Casper Stockham
- Diana DeGette
- Raymon Anthony Doane

The candidate results were:
- Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 votes.
- Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.
- Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 votes.

The winner of the election was:
- Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.
## Challenge Overview
The challenge tasked us with writing a Python script which would allow us to find each county's total votes cast and the percentage of the total votes cast in the election. The challenge was made somewhat easier in that we were able to re-purpose much of the code that we had used in finding the individual candidate results. However, there were a few pieces of the puzzle which had to be discovered on our own through critical thinking.
## Challenge Summary
The Python script which was used to find the individual candidate and county results for the congressional election is a powerful tool for the election commission going forward. The code used in this election could certainly be applied to local and state elections of all kinds with some modifications specific to each election. The majority of the work is already done and it would be a massive time saver to modify the existing code and re-deploy for future elections.
